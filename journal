# June 29th: Brainstormed ideas and found one

I wanted a simple and usable idea, and I went through various YouTube tutorials and projects to find one. I ended up wanting to make an SD card reader, but I realized that I was a bit too much of a beginner for that. I found a Hackclub jam on USB ports and thought that making something similar should work out. 

[insert pictures of what you're working on!]

Total time spent: 7h
