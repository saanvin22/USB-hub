# June 30th: Brainstormed ideas and found one

I wanted a simple and usable idea, and I went through various YouTube tutorials and projects to find one. I ended up wanting to make an SD card reader, but I realized that I was a bit too much of a beginner for that. I found a Hackclub jam on USB ports and thought that making something similar should work out. From there, it was a matter of understanding the tutorial. I was able to get the hand of the schematics pretty quickly, and the bits of knowlege (ie: learning about the specs and acronyms) in the tutorial made it useful for when I added the addional port. The wiring was my favorite part, and I found it relaxing.

Once that was done, I shifted it over to the actual pcb. The layout for EasyEDA and KiCad were extremely similar, and I was able to navigate the traces with suprising ease. It took a while for me to find a layout that I liked that didn't look messy, and I think I readjusted the components around 6 times.
