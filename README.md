# USB-hub
A small personalized USB hub for my devices and cables. I created this to gain further experience through a simple hardware project. I have been needing one for a while, and it was a good learning experience.

The case will be attached with the glue tape I already own. Parts ordered through LCSC, PCB through JLPPCB
