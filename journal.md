# July 30th: Brainstormed ideas and found one

I wanted a simple and usable idea, and I went through various YouTube tutorials and projects to find one. I ended up wanting to make an SD card reader, but I realized that I was a bit too much of a beginner for that. I found a Hackclub jam on USB ports and thought that making something similar should work out. From there, it was a matter of understanding the tutorial. I was able to get the hand of the schematics pretty quickly, and the bits of knowlege (ie: learning about the specs and acronyms) in the tutorial made it useful for when I added the addional port. The wiring was my favorite part, and I found it relaxing.

Once that was done, I shifted it over to the actual PCB. The layout for EasyEDA and KiCad was extremely similar, and I was able to navigate the traces with surprising ease. It took a while for me to find a layout that I liked that didn't look messy, and I think I readjusted the components around 6 times.

# July 31st: Finished the cad and project

Since I had the schematic and PCB ready to go, I focused on creating the CAD and getting this project ready to submit. The Cad is the main area of my expertise, but I was extremely stumped as to how to design the cad with the layout of the PCB in mind. I ended up going with a single block design with a hollowed-out middle for the PCB, and the rod on the side will be used to ensure that the PCB doesn't fall out. I also have these plastic panel things at home, and I want to experiment with potentially putting those on the hub and seeing how I can personalize it. I also filleted the edges for a smoother look and nicer feel. That is all for this project.
